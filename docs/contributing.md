# Contributing to the Wiki

Updating the content of the wiki is simple, push the new content to the main branch. You don't need to create a separate branch and submit a pull request. After that, inform other contributors of said changes to keep them aware.

For more information about customizing the wiki : [documentation](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify)

## Adding new pages

1. Create the `.md` file inside the `docs` directory.
2. Update the `_sidebar.md` accordingly ([example](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/blob/master/docs/_sidebar.md?plain=1))
