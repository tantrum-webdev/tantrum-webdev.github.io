> I want to build a new app that would allow user to create and store magic the gathering decks in different formats. It would consist of two main pages: One listing the existing decks, where the user can filter the list, import / export items, and create new decks. The other being the deck page, where the user can edit / look at a specific deck. Can you give me outlines of sections I'd need to have on those pages

## Deck List Page:

1. Deck Filters: Allow users to filter decks by format, color, name, etc.
2. Deck List: Display a list of decks with their name, format, and maybe an image or icon.
3. Create New Deck: A button or link to create a new deck.
4. Import / Export: Options for importing or exporting decks in different file formats (e.g. .txt, .csv, .mtga).
5. Sorting: Allow users to sort decks by name, date created, last modified, etc.
6. Pagination: If there are a lot of decks, consider adding pagination to the list.

## Deck Edit Page:

1. Deck Information: Display deck name, format, colors, and maybe a description.
2. Card List: Display a list of all the cards in the deck with their quantity, name, and maybe an image or icon.
3. Add / Remove Cards: Allow users to add or remove cards from the deck.
4. Card Search: A search bar that allows users to search for specific cards by name, color, type, etc.
5. Save / Discard Changes: Buttons to save or discard changes made to the deck.
6. Deck Export: Option to export the deck in different file formats (e.g. .txt, .csv, .mtga).
7. Deck Stats: Display various statistics about the deck such as card breakdown by color, type, and rarity.

> Can you refine the deck list page outline, giving me more details on the visual aspect

1. Deck Filters: Consider using dropdown menus or checkboxes to allow users to select filter options such as format, colors, and name. Make sure the filter options are clearly labeled and easy to understand.

2. Deck List: Display each deck as a card with its name, format, and an image or icon. You may also want to include other details such as the date created or last modified. Make sure the cards are visually appealing and easy to scan through.

3. Create New Deck: Use a prominent button or link to encourage users to create a new deck. You may want to use a contrasting color to make the button stand out. Consider using a modal or form to guide users through the deck creation process.

4. Import / Export: Provide clear buttons or links to allow users to import or export decks. You may want to use icons or labels to help users understand what each button does. Consider including a tooltip or pop-up to explain the import/export process.

5. Sorting: Use clickable headers or dropdown menus to allow users to sort the deck list by various criteria such as name, date created, and format. Consider using arrows or icons to indicate the sort order.

6. Pagination: If there are many decks in the list, consider breaking the list into pages to improve performance and usability. Use clear navigation links or buttons to allow users to move between pages.

> Can you tell me if I am missing an important feature on this page

1. Search Bar: Adding a search bar can help users quickly find the deck they're looking for, especially if they have a large collection. You may want to allow users to search by name, format, colors, or other criteria.

2. Deck Sharing: Allowing users to share their decks with others can be a great way to build a community around your app. Consider adding a share button or link that generates a unique URL for each deck, which users can then share on social media or other platforms.

3. Deck Ratings or Reviews: Adding a rating or review system can help users discover popular or well-regarded decks. You may want to allow users to rate decks on various criteria such as playability, creativity, or fun factor, and display an average rating for each deck.

4. Deck Statistics: Displaying statistics such as the number of times a deck has been viewed or played can help users make informed decisions about which decks to try. You may want to track these statistics over time and display trends or graphs to show how a deck's popularity has changed.

> If we add the search bar and deck sharing features you mentioned to the list, can you give me an outline of the design of the page

1. Header: The header should include your app's logo and a navigation menu that allows users to access other parts of your app. Consider adding a search bar to the header, which users can use to search for decks by name, format, colors, or other criteria.

2. Filters: Use dropdown menus or checkboxes to allow users to filter decks by format, colors, name, or other criteria. Make sure the filter options are clearly labeled and easy to understand.

3. Deck List: Display each deck as a card with its name, format, and an image or icon. You may also want to include other details such as the date created, last modified, or number of times viewed. Add a share button or link to each deck card that allows users to generate a unique URL for the deck.

4. Create New Deck: Use a prominent button or link to encourage users to create a new deck. You may want to use a contrasting color to make the button stand out. Consider using a modal or form to guide users through the deck creation process.

5. Import / Export: Provide clear buttons or links to allow users to import or export decks. You may want to use icons or labels to help users understand what each button does. Consider including a tooltip or pop-up to explain the import/export process.

6. Sorting: Use clickable headers or dropdown menus to allow users to sort the deck list by various criteria such as name, date created, and format. Consider using arrows or icons to indicate the sort order.

7. Pagination: If there are many decks in the list, consider breaking the list into pages to improve performance and usability. Use clear navigation links or buttons to allow users to move between pages.

8. Deck Sharing: Consider adding a section that displays the most popular or well-regarded decks based on ratings or reviews. Allow users to rate decks on various criteria such as playability, creativity, or fun factor, and display an average rating for each deck. Add social sharing buttons or links to each deck card that allow users to share the deck on social media or other platforms.

Overall, aim for a clean and organized design that allows users to quickly find the deck they are looking for. Use consistent styling and layout throughout the page to make it easy to use and visually appealing.
