# Tantrum-webdev Wiki

## Big Picture

Create many versions of the same application using a different tech stack each time. This allows contributors to compare and generate informed opinions over each stack.

Each iteration will provide the same base features, with room to add variations. This approach emulates the life cycle of a real product that sees its features evolve over time.

This wiki provides global guidelines and documentation. Make sure to be aware of them when contributing. Doing so will maintain coding consistency between each project. These guidelines will also evolve over time to better fit contributors' needs.

## Application

The application is a deck viewer and builder for the "Magic: The Gathering" Trading Card Game (TCG).

As a user of the application, the base user stories would allow the user to :

- See the list of decks.
- Create a new deck from scratch.
- Import a deck from another source.
- Look at the content of an existing deck.
- Edit the content of an existing deck.
- Export a deck as a text file.

To get the data needed, the application will use the [magicthegathering.io API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/).

Check the [Application page](application.md) for more details.
