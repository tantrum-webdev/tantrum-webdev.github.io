## Big Picture

The main goal is to let contributors explore tech stacks while building the same base application each time. This allows everyone to experience implementation differences between stacks on identical features and form their own opinion and preferences over stacks.

Having the same application base used over multiple projects doesn't imply that every application iteration will contain the exact same features. Each new stack iteration could add / remove features, emulating what could happen to a single real app product over its lifetime.

The development of the application will follow defined guidelines and structures to allow organization/code consistency between repositories. Those definitions are not set in stone and will change based on feedback between iterations.

## Application

The project will consist of a deck builder for the "Magic: The Gathering" TCG. A user will be able to check a list of created/imported decks, consult/edit them and create new ones. Those decks could also be exported to a common format to be used by other applications.

The application will use the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) to obtain card informations. Depending on features specifications this could change or other APIs could be added.

Check the [Application page](application.md) for more details.
